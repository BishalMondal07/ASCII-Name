# Text to ASCII Converter
This is a Python program that prints out an ASCII art representation of a given name. The program prompts the user to enter their name and then prints each letter of the name using ASCII art.

# Usage
1. Run the program by executing the NameMagic.py file in a Python environment.

2. Enter your name when prompted.

3. The program will print each letter of your name using ASCII art.

# How it Works
The program works by taking each character in the user's input and using a series of conditional statements to determine which ASCII art representation to print. If the character is a letter, a corresponding ASCII art letter is printed. If the character is a space, a blank line is printed to create space between words. If the character is a period, a special ASCII art pattern is printed.

# Supported Characters
This program supports the following characters: A-Z, space, and period. Any other characters entered will be ignored.



#Example

Here's an example of what the output might look like when the user enters the name "John":

```bash
Enter your name: 

John

....##....
